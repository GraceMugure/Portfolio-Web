# Portfolio-Web

This is my personal portfolio website. Here I will showcase my skills, projects, and experiences as a developer.

## Technologies Used

## Description
This website serves as a platform to display my projects and achievements. It features a dark/light mode toggle functionality, where users can switch between themes for a personalized experience. The dark/light mode is implemented using JavaScript, and the styles are applied through CSS variables, which makes the website visually dynamic and interactive.

## Features
- Dark/Light Mode Toggle: Users can switch between dark and light themes for a personalized experience.
- Responsive Design: The portfolio is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, including desktops and tablets.
- Contact Form: The website includes a contact form to allow users to send messages and get in touch.
